What is Hypothesis?
A hypothesis is a possible view or assertion of a data scientist about the problem he or she is working on. It may or may not be true

Why do we need Hypothesis Generation?
As data scientist, it is not make sense to first see the data in detail, spend some time with it, and then dive into what we can test and analyze
	Non-hypothesis driven data analysis:
		- Collect the entire data
		- Analyze every variable available
		- Could lead to narrow vision
	Hypothesis driven analysis
		- List hypothesis BEFORE looking at data
		- Smaller & specific pieces to work with
		- Provides an UNBIASED view
		Exhaustive set -> Collect data -> test each hypothesis 
	Who joint to this phase? Stakeholders / Data Science team / Marketing Team / Sales Team
	-> Involve all the relevant people / team in the brainstorming process. This is how an exhoustive list of hypothesis is built.
