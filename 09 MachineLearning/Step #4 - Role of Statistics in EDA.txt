What is Statistics?
Statistics is set of rules and concepts for analysis and interpretation of the data. 

Role of Statistics in EDA: 
+ Univariate: 
	- central tendencies (mean, median, mode), range, average
	- distributions and 
	- spread of data
+ Bivariate
	- relationship b/w variables: correlation or covariance which define how the variables depend on each other
	- similarity/hypothesis testing which allow us to quantify whether the two samples are significantly similar, or different from each other
+ Experiments (in order to see if we can make business more profitable)
	- T-tests (one-sample, paired, two-sample) allow us to quantify whether the experiments were successful or not
+ Population Estimation: central limit theorem (approximate the 2 parameters of the entire data, with the help of many small groups of the data.

Descriptive Statistics
Descriptive Statistics deals with the summarization of the data at hand by means of central tendency, spread of the data or relation between two variables. 
	- Summarising
	- Central tendency
	- Spread of data
	- Relation b/w variables

Inferential Statistics
Inferential Statistics is used to approximate population estimate from sample data.
	- Approximation
	- Sampling
	- Error analysis of sample
