Random Experiment - Phép thử ngẫu nhiên
+ Random experiment is a process with a number of possible outcomes.
+ Those outcomes are not necessarily certain
+ can be repeated numerous times under the same conditions
+ Generally the outcome of an individual random experiment is independent and identically distributed. It implies that probability of one trial is independent of other trials, and they are equally likely.  


Sample Space (S) - Không gian mẫu
Sample Space associated with a random experiment is a set of all possible outcomes  

Event - sự kiện
An event is a subset of Sample Space

Probability
The probability of an Event E, is a number P, between 0 and 1 that measures the likelihood that Event will occur.

P(event) = (count of outcomes in Event) / (count of outcomes in Sample Space)

P = 0 -> impossible event
P = 1 -> Certain event

Basic concepts of Probability:
+ Complements
+ Union
+ Intersections

Complement - Sự kiện đối
The complement of an event E is a sample space S, is the collection of all outcomes in S that are not elements of the set E
P(E^c) = 1 - P(E)

Intersection - Sự kiện giao
Intersection (n) is the collection of all outcomes that are common in events
P(A n B) = 

Union - Sự kiện hợp
Union (u) is the collection of all outcomes that are elements of any of the events.
P(A u B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A n B)

Axiom 3: Mutually Exclusive Event - Two events, A and B are said to be mutually exclusive if they cannot occur together (have no common elements)

Mutually Exhoustive Event - means that the events together make up everything that can possibly happen.
