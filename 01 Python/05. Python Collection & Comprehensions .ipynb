    "# Generators\n",
    "Generator functions allow you to declare a function that behaves like an iterator, i.e. it can be used in a for loop. This greatly simplifies your code and is much more memory efficient than a simple for loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider an example where we want to add up all of the numbers from 1 to 1000. The first part of the code below illustrates how you would do this using a for loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that’s all fine and dandy if the list is small, say a length of 1000. The problem arises when you want to do this with a huge list, say 1 billion float numbers. With a for loop, that massive memory chewing list is created in memory — not everyone has unlimited RAM to store such a thing! The range() function in Python does the same thing, it builds the list in memory\n",
    "Section (2) of the code illustrates the summing of the list of numbers using a Python generator. A generator will create elements and store them in memory only as it needs them i.e one at a time. That means, if you have to create 1 billion floating point numbers, you’ll only be storing them in memory one at a time! The xrange() function in Python uses generators to build lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moral of the story: If you have a large range that you’d like to generate a list for, use a generator or the xrange function. This is especially true if you have a really memory sensitive system such as mobile or at-the-edge computing.\n",
    "That being said, if you’d like to iterate over the list multiple times and it’s small enough to fit into memory, it will be better to use for loops and the range function. This is because generators and xrange will be freshly generating the list values every time you access them, whereas range is a static list and the integers already exist in memory for quick access."
