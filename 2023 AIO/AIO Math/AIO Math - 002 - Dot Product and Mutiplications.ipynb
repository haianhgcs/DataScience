    "## Concept 1 - Definition of dot product\n",
    "The dot product, also known as the Euclidean inner product, is a fundamental operation in linear algebra that serves as a building block for many algorithms and operations, such as con-volution, correlation, matrix multiplication, signal filtering, Fourier transform, and linear feature extraction [1].\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different notations for representing the dot product of two vectors, but the most common one is $a^Tb$, which will be further explained after introducing matrix multiplication. An-other one is $a\\cdot b$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dot product is a scalar value that indicates the relationship between two vectors. To compute the dot product, one needs to multiply the corresponding elements of the vectors and then sum the resulting products."

    "Hadamard multiplication refers to the process of performing element-wise multiplication between two vectors. It is also known as the Schur product or the entrywise product. To perform Hadamard multiplication, you multiply each corresponding element in the two vectors. For example, if you have two vectors A and B, their Hadamard product would be denoted as $a \\odot b$, where $\\odot$ represents the element-wise multiplication operator. The resulting vector will have the same dimensionality as the two original vectors.\n",
